WE CONFIGURED A VNC ON THE LINUX WORKSTATION (MACHINE AT THE VERY END OF THE CFD LAB)

IN ORDER TO REMOTE IT VIA VNC, PLEASE FOLLOW THESE STEPS:

1. DONWLOAD AND CONNECT TO THE GLOBAL PROTECT VPN (IF YOU HAVE NOT DONE SO)
2. DOWNLOAD THE TIGER VNC VIEWER
3. OPEN A CMD TERMINAL (ON WINDOWS) AND TYPE:
    ssh -L 5901:localhost:5901 user@157.182.196.87
4. ENTER THE PASSWORD:
    abc123 
5. OPEN THE TIGER VNC VIEWER AND ENTER INTO THE VNC SERVER:
   localhost:5901
6. AGAIN ENTER PASSWORD:
     abc123
     
IMPORTANT

THIS IS A PERSISTENT SESSION, SO ALL OF YOUR STUFF WILL STAY OPEN
JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS TO CONSIDER: 

This is using the vncserver binary to start the vnc session. 
If you aren’t able to connect to the session, type “vncserver -list” 
That will show you any sessions that are listening and the corresponding port. 
If there aren’t any, you can type “vncserver :1” and that will start a session listening on port 5901.
