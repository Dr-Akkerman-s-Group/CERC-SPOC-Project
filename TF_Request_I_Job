To request an interactive job in Thorny Flat, do it samely as in Spruce, except for the X forwarding option (which is not available in TF)
All other commands remain the same, so please type them manually in the terminal:

module load ansys/fluids_19.2

cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
nprocs=`wc -l $PBS_NODEFILE | awk '{ print $1 }'`

fluent -gu 3d -ssh -cnf=$PBS_NODEFILE -mpi=ibmmpi -t40 -i /gpfs20/scratch/ai0013/gideon/ParticleStudy_Axelbaum/inputload_wvel.in

;Optionally you can start Fluent by reading a journal file, specified by -i "working/address", if you dont want, then remove it.
;Be sure to specify your number of processors each time you open a session, -t40 = 40 proc to be loaded, -t32 = 32 proce to be loaded, and so on...

If you want to check your system statics and validate your processors were loaded correctly, please type

report/system/sys-stats
